===Windforge Kickstarter Item Unlock Method===

==Intro==

Windforge is a fantastic game created by Snowed in Studios.
It was funded on Kickstarter, which included numerous stretch goals that featured in-game items.

Unfortunately Snowed in have abandoned supporting the game, meaning the chance of getting the kickstarter items as
DLC or added later is unlikely.

But given they're no longer paying attention to it, and that the game is now 2 years old, I have no problem sharing the
Kickstarter items with the world!

==How it works==

This works by overwriting some of the base files in the game with new ones so that the quests for the Kickstarter items
are added when...

1) On load of an existing game, or
2) At the start of a new game.

The two quests will be marked Backer Armor and Backer Weapons specifically, and are accessed after completing the tutorial
(When you first enter Engelstrom)

==What you do==

=1) Unpack the BIG.FILE=
You'll first of all need to unpack the BIG.FILE, which contains all the games data.
Two methods are include in the root of this folder.
1) wf-reader-1.0, by silver7017 (http://forum.snowedin.ca/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=202)
2) wfde.py, by Yiab (http://steamcommunity.com/app/266170/discussions/0/35222218703547024/)

***NOTE***

Visit those respective links for more information. Use these at your own peril.
They're not my work, belonging to their respective creators, but they help make this mod work.

=2) Copy Contents=
The "Windforge" folder in this root contains the data-files you need to replace.

The easiest way to do this is to copy and paste it into your "Steam\steamapps\common" folder (if installed by steam)
or wherever you installed it otherwise.

Then, when prompted, choose to overwrite the existing files with these new ones.
They're in the correct order, and only contain the altered files, so this should be fine. But just in case, always make a backup.

=3) Start the game=

You should now start the game, don't worry that the big.file is unpacked, it'll all still work.
Now check your quest log and see the new quests!

Have fun with the items! (The boots are Overpowered...)
