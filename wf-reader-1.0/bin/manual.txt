A few basic things:

 * all commands are written in the form (command) or (command parameter1 parameter2)

 * all filenames MUST use either forward slash (/) or double backslash (\\) as a directory seperator
   (trust me, windows will understand what you mean)

these are a result of the programming language I used, and the fact that I haven't put any
time into the user interface yet. the easiest way to use this, if you have a different
Steam directory, is to run the commands:
	(set-dir "C:\\[mysteamfolder]\\SteamApps\\common\\Windforge\\Data\\BIG.FILE")
	(extract-all)
if you'd like to extract the files anywhere else, read on


available commands:
(set-dir [path])
	sets the working directory to something other than the default. use this
	if your steam is installed somewhere other than the default location.

ex: (set-dir "C:\\things\\install\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Windforge\\Data\\BIG.FILE")

(extract-all [file path] [extract path])
	extracts the contents of the data file found at [file path], and puts them
	at the directory specified by [extract path]. if no [extract path] is given,
	the files will be extracted to the same directory as the [file path]. if no
	[file path] is given, it will assume the default location. if you want to
	extract from the default location, but to a different place, use
	(extract-all *wf-default* [extract path]) instead.
ex: (extract-all "C:\\things\\install\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Windforge\\Data\\BIG.FILE" "C:\\work\\files\\")
    (extract-all "D:\\Steam\\SteamApps\\common\\Windforge\\Data\\BIG.FILE")
    (extract-all *wf-default* "C:\\work\\files\\")


(load-wf-data [path])
	loads the wf-header for the specified file into memory so it can be manipulated.
	unless you know what you are doing, you probably don't need to do this.
	[path] is optional.
